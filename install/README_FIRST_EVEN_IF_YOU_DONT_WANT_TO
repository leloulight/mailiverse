Things you must do for this to work out of the box:


1.  You must have .ssh keys for this account..

If you don't have them, generate them by googling "generate .ssh keys" and doing whatever it says.





2.  You must go into the requirements directory and run "./get_rsa_pub"

This will get the .ssh public key and put it in this directory so it can be easily transfered
to the target machine.


3.  You must go into the requirements directory and modify "server_root_account" to have whatever the root account
(which must have sudo priviledges) name is.


4.  If you are going to use EC2 to test this install you must

   a.  copy the server key.pem file into the requirements directory and soft link ec2-key.pem to it via
         ln -fs your-key-file.pem ec2-key.pem

   b.  go back to the install directory and run "./enable_ec2_login THE_SERVER_IP"


5.  If you are NOT going to use EC2, you MUST make the root account publickey accessible from the machine you are
installing off of.  Take a look at "enable_ec2_login" for what this means.


---

Ok now you are ready to go.

from the install directory type in

./setup-server YOUR-SERVER-IP-NAME-WHATEVER

and it should create the various accounts for the system and enable ssh publickey access to them.
it should download apache james and enable it
