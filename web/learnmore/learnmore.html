		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<div class="faq">
		<ul>
		
		<li><div class="question">Why is {##TITLE##} different from all the other web mail services?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		After mail has been received, encrypted and relayed to your store, {##TITLE##} <b>cannot</b> read your mail.  This means
		{##TITLE##} cannot profile you, cannot reveal information, cannot sell information.  {##TITLE##} is here to provide you
		with a mail service, not mine data for advertising.
		</div>
		</li>

		<li><div class="question">Can people read my e-mail by snooping on the wifi?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		No.  No mail nor caches are <b>ever</b> transmitted so that others can read them.  That's the whole point of this service.
		</div>
		</li>
		
		<li><div class="question">Can people read my e-mail by snooping on my computer?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		Yes!  Do not ever enter your password on a computer which potentially has a key logger.  We cannot protect you if your computer has been
		compromised, nor if your keystrokes are monitored.
		</div>
		</li>
		
		<li><div class="question">Is there any way I can check that things are encrypted?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		Open Chrome/IE/Firefox and turn on the respective debuggers.  Watch the network requests which take place and read the contents of the responses.  Trace through their respective decryption.
		</div>
		</li>
		
		<li><div class="question">How strong <b>is</b> this encryption?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		We use 2048 bit RSA keys (RSA-AES-CBC-256-PKCS7) to encrypt your mail. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">Wikipedia:RSA</a>).<br/>
		We use AES-CBC-256-PKCS7 to encrypt caches. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Wikipedia:AES</a>).
		</div>
		</li>
	
		<li><div class="question">How is my mail encrypted?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		When mail is received by the {##TITLE##} server it is encrypted with the your RSA Public Key. This keeps your mail so that only you can read it.<br/>
		</div>
		</li>
		
		<li><div class="question">How can I read my mail if it is encrypted?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		When you login via the web, you authenticate with our server and receive your <b>encrypted</b> RSA Key block.<br/>
		You decrypt this key block and use the embedded keys to read and cache your mail - in javascript on the client - <b>no</b> server is involved.<br/>
		</div>
		</li>
		
		<li><div class="question">If a government or law enforcement agency asks {##TITLE##} for my e-mail will you give it to them?</div>
		<div class="answer">
		Yes.  {##TITLE##} will give them any information as required by law.  But it doesn't matter.  Here is why:<br/>
		{##TITLE##}'s authentication scheme is setup in a way that {##TITLE##} cannot read your mail.  Nor can anybody else.
		<p>
		That is the whole point of this service: no more profiling corporation, no more big brother.
