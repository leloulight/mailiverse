This is an XCode project for building the binary boost libraries for iOS. To
get it working follow these steps:

1. Get the boost sources from http://www.boost.org/users/download/ (probably
   it will only work with version 1.44).
2. Open the XCode project and right-click (or control click) on the boost
   group, select 'Get Info'. On the 'General' tab select 'Choose...' and
   select the root folder of the boost sources.
3. Open the project settings and change the BOOST_ROOT setting to match the
   location where you extracted the boost archive.
4. Select the boost_all target. This is a dummy target that depends on all
   libraries so you can build everything at once. Select the target SDK and
   build configuration. Build. Alternatively you can build only the libraries
   you require.

At this point you may get some compiler errors. Check the following:

* Make sure that the boost group is not red, if it is repeat step 2.
* boost_program_options will not compile, see
  <https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5053>. You will need to apply the
  patch available there or remove that library from your build.
* Make sure you have boost version 1.44. If you have another version you may
  have to tweak the configuration.

To use the libraries you can either compile them and copy them to your project
or add your code to this project. The first option has the problem that you
will need a separate version for the simulator, you might want to look into
lipo. With the second option you don't have to worry about separate versions
and you will be able to debug into the library code.

Don't try moving the sources to another project, you will most likely break
the build. Also do not remove the references to boost library and do not add
the boost source tree to the project. You will break the build.
